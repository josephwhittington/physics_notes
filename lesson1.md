### Definitions
Scalars - defined entirely by a number
Force - direction and magnitude
Velocity - 
Acceleration - 
Momentum - 

### Kinematics
Motion in a straight line
-   Position
    -   Measured from a frame of reference (origin)
    -   The sign (+-) is really a direction
    -   Displacement - Change in Position
        (delta)X = X2 - X1
        (delta)X1 = (->XF) - (->Xi)
    -   Displacement is a vector
    -   Displacement - how far smething moved and in what direction it moved.
-   Average Velocity
    -   (->Vavg) = (delta)X/(delta)T = [(->X2) - (->X1)]/[t2 - t1]
    -   Directly proportional - two variables that changes at the same rate of speed
    -   Inversely proportional - two variables that change in inverse proportions
    -   Displacement
    -   Speed - Is the magnitude of velocity (no direction, scalar)
    -   Savg = [Total Distance]/[(delta)t]
-   Instantaneous velocity
    -   How fast something is moving at that instant
    -   (->v) = lim((delta)t->0)[(delta)X/(delta)t] = dx/dt; v = velocity(m/s); x = distance(m) t = time(s)
-   Problem: What is the avg velocity of a cat that travels 150 mters East in 2 secs?
d = 150m
t = 2s
-   Average Acceleration
    -   The rate at chich velocity changes
    -   Positive acceleration mans an object is speeding up 
    -   Negative acceleration means an object is either at rest or moving at a constanct velocity.
-   Instantaneous Acceleration 
    -   HowThe rate at chich velocity changes over time
-   Constant acceleration
    -   (->V) = at + V0
    -   Setting t = 0 we can see V0 is the starting velocity
    -   Motion over time
        -   (->X) = (1/2)at^2 + V0t + X0
    -   X0 is starting Position
    -   Acceleration of gravity is constant
        -   9.8 m/s^2
-   Free fall
    -   An object is in free fall when:
        -   the only force acting on a falling object is gravity
        -   there is zero or negligible air resistence
-   Vector Components
    -   Based on any orthogonal coordinate system (they are all correct).
    -   Cartesian has x, y & z directions
        -   Unit vectors I, J & K
    -   Thus we write (->a) = a_x\*I + a_y\*J + a_z\*K
    -   (->r) - position vector
    -   a_x = acos(theta), a_y = asin(theta), tan(theta) = a_y/a_x
    -   Adding/ Subtracting vetors is trivial - result will always be a vector.
    -   Scalar- vector multiplication - result is a vector
    -   Scalar Product or Dot Product - result is a scalar
-   Projectile Motion
    -   A projectile is any bject moving through space only through the infulence of air resistance and gravity.
    -   PARABOLA: Te shape of the curved path path of the Projectile
    -   They curved path results from 2 important facts about projectiles.
        -   The have constant horizontal Motion
        -   They have accelerated vertical motion
-
